# Leeroy

Project Leeroy, a Tool Management System (TMS), was designed to enable computer science students to innovate through an easy access to proper developer tools such as Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and subversion systems. 
The whole environment is easily manageable through a Joomla extension and can be configured to be completely autonomous.

The project is composed of the Joomla component allowing the users to control the second part composed of different services(OpenVZ, ISPConfig...).
Everything has been tested as functional on a Debian 6 server.
